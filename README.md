# Reinforcement-Learning-on-text-based-gridworld

This is a simulation driven by two separate RL algorithms called Q-learning and SARSA. The simulation includes a robot which tries to learn the shortest safest path from a given position to a certain point in a grid, simulating an autonomous vehicle. The user will be able to compare the algorithms using data generated during the simulation and evaluate their effectiveness and performance. The environment and RL agent were programmed in pure C++ whereas the graphs are generated using Python.
